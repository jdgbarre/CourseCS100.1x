# Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark | edX

**Final grade**: 84%

**About this course**: Organizations use their data for decision support and to build data-intensive products and services, such as recommendation, prediction, and diagnostic systems. The collection of skills required by organizations to support these functions has been grouped under the term Data Science. This course will attempt to articulate the expected output of Data Scientists and then teach students how to use PySpark (part of Apache Spark) to deliver against these expectations. The course assignments include Log Mining, Textual Entity Recognition, and Collaborative Filtering exercises that teach students how to manipulate datasets using parallel processing with PySpark.
